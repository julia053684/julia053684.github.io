This October, the national "Stoptober" campaign brings the issue of smoking to prominence once more. Smoking is associated with a variety of increased health risks including: cancers; high blood pressure; and a variety of respiratory problems.  There are also risks for non-smokers exposed to "second hand" tobacco smoke, especially children, a factor behind the new UK Law to be introduced on October 1st 2015, prohibiting smoking an a vehicle if someone under the age of 18 is travelling inside. 

Whilst I can assure you I am a firm believer in freedom of choice, in my own experience, not every smoker is smoking by choice and because they enjoy doing so. Very often, it’s because they feel trapped by a habit that they would now like to stop.

Everyone has their own, unique reasons, and motivation to stop smoking. Popular reasons are*:

  1.	**Improved health** – not just for the smoker, but also their family. Even within the first 24 hours after a smoker gives up, health begins to improve! First the heart rate drops; carbon monoxide levels drop; over time heart attack and cancer risks drop…you get the picture! 
  2.	**Cash savings** – not just on cigarettes at around £8.29 for 20, but also things like life insurance (smokers pay an estimated 15 – 50% for life insurance.)
  3.	**Improved appearance (and smell!)** – smoking is associated with the development of wrinkles, yellowed teeth, fingers and nails. It also has a lingering odour on skin, clothes, vehicles and in the home. The good news being that after stopping smoking, skin begins to repair and other signs of smoking fade quickly.

Once I have established your unique motivation, there are many ways in which hypnosis can help. This might include strategies to deal with smoking triggers, e.g. smoking associated with social drinking; to dealing with concerns about weight gain due to the regaining of a sense of taste and subsequent pleasure in eating! (Yes, hypnosis can help here too!)

One benefit of using hypnosis to help you stop smoking is that allows you to access your internal resources, both conscious and unconscious, in a receptive, often relaxed, state. This permits you to replace unwanted habits with more positive and beneficial behaviours. Hypnosis can also circumvent the distraction of conscious negative thoughts, which can stand in the way of making the changes you wish to make. 

Habit based smoking cessation is often achieved successfully in a single session. Alternatively, if you feel your smoking may be linked to other concerns, such as forming part of your "stress management" routine, then a multi-session approach can be adopted. My aim is to help you access and develop the resources you need to deal with these, allowing you to reach your goal of becoming a non-smoker. 
All of our work is done together collaboratively in a safe, friendly and professional environment. The key to your success lies within you, as a hypnotherapist, my role is to help you access your internal resources and support you in your journey towards making the positive change you wish to see.  

So, if any of this has "ignited" the desire to stop smoking, and you feel that a little hypnotic help might be just the thing for you, if you want to find out more or book an appointment please feel to email me, on [julia@continuum-hypnosis.co.uk](mailto:julia@continuum-hypnosis.co.uk) or give me a call.
