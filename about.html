    <p>I trained in clinical hypnotherapy because I wanted to find out it’s benefits both for myself and others.</p>

    <p>I utilise hypnosis techniques in combination with Positive Psychology Principles to help clients to “step back” and gain insight into their issues, allowing them to generate options and strategies to resolve these.</p>
 
    <p>Positive Psychology advocates that we can all benefit from focussing on positive emotions and developing our own unique individual strengths.</p>

    <p>I offer a professional and welcoming clinical hypnotherapy and coaching service where we can work together, at an agreed pace, to address the goals that are important to you.</p>
