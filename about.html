<p>Working for over  20 years in forensics and as a manager, my interest in Forensic Psychology led to an MSc in this subject. However, my interest in psychology extended far beyond forensic psychology.</p>

<p>The modern workplace is one full of competing pressures which each person individuals handles differently, and with varying degrees of success. Experiencing first hand the effects of anxiety related to workplace performance led to my interest in clinical hypnotherapy. Used to forensic evaluation of “facts”, I was pleased to find a large amount of empirical evidence supporting the use of hypnosis in the treatment of many clinical conditions which led to my training in this field. My practice is firmly founded in evidence based hypnotherapy techniques.</p>

<p>Since training in clinical hypnotherapy, I have found helping individuals overcome personal issues, and search for personal and professional development every bit as rewarding as my many years devoted to solving crimes!</p> 

<p>I use hypnosis alongside cognitive behavioural therapy techniques to work together to achieve your agreed goals in a tailor made treatment plan unique to your needs.</p>

<h3>My Training</h3>

<p>I studied with the London College of Clinical Hypnosis, achieving a Post Graduate Diploma in Clinical Hypnotherapy in 2013.</p>

<p>I am currently studying towards the UK’s first MSc in Clinical Hypnotherapy with the University of West London and anticipate completing this in 2014.</p>

<p>My particular area of study is the effect focussing on positive events in the workplace can have on levels of mental well-being.</p>
