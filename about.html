    <p>I trained in clinical hypnotherapy because I wanted to find out it’s benefits both for myself and others.  I utilise hypnosis techniques in combination with Positive Psychology Principles to help clients to “step back” and gain insight into their issues, allowing them to generate options and strategies to resolve these.  Positive Psychology advocates that we can all benefit from focussing on positive emotions and developing our own unique individual strengths.</p>

    <p>Why Continuum Hypnosis?</p>

    <p>A continuum is something that keeps going and changes slowly over time, but when you look at the beginning and end, these are quite distinctly different.  To me this reflects the process of change as we learn and develop over the course of our everyday lives. Making small manageable changes in how we think and behave can have a huge impact on how we feel. Using a variety of hypnotherapy techniques, tailored specifically to your needs,  allows me to help you accelerate making changes along your development continuum.</p>

    <p>I offer a professional and welcoming clinical hypnotherapy service where we can work together, at an agreed pace, to address the goals that are important to you.</p>
