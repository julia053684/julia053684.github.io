<p>It’s hard to describe the hypnotic state as everyone experiences this differently.  Brain scans have shown that the hypnotic experience is not the same as sleep, but similar to the kind of state you feel when you are caught up in reading a good book and your attention becomes narrowed and you become less “tuned in” to the things going on around you. In a therapeutic setting, hypnosis is frequently associated with focussing on achieving a state of relaxation, where a person can be receptive to positive suggestions.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, most people can be hypnotised if they have the ability to pay attention to normal events.</p> 

<p>No one can make you do anything in hypnosis, any more than they could in everyday life.</p>
