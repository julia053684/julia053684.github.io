    <p>It’s hard to describe the hypnotic state as everyone experiences this differently.</p>

    <p>Brain scans have shown that the hypnotic experience is not the same as sleep, but similar to the kind of state you feel when you are caught up in reading a good book and your attention becomes narrowed and you become less “tuned in” to the things going on around you. In a therapeutic setting, hypnosis is frequently associated with focussing on achieving a state of relaxation, where a person can be receptive to positive suggestions.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, most people can be hypnotised if they have the ability to pay attention to normal events.</p> 

    <p>No one can make you do anything in hypnosis, any more than they could in everyday life.</p>

    <p>Self-hypnosis allows you to purposefully achieve a focused, relaxed state on your own, where you can give yourself positive suggestions without the requirement for these to be given by another person, such as the hypnotherapist. Self-hypnosis is something I regularly practice myself for a variety of reasons. The ability to intentionally relax can in itself be an important step towards improving general health and well-being.</p>

    <p>I teach self-hypnosis to all clients, for whom it is appropriate and who will benefit form learning this skill, using a variety of methods tailored to each individual.</p>
