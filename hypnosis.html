    <p>Brain scans have shown that the hypnotic experience is not the same as sleep, but similar to the kind of state you feel when you are caught up in reading a good book and your attention becomes narrowed and you become less “tuned in” to the things going on around you. In a therapeutic setting, hypnosis is frequently associated with focussing on achieving a state of relaxation, where a person can be receptive to positive suggestions.</p>
