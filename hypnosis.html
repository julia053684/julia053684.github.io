    <p>Everyone experiences the hypnotic state differently.  Brain scans have shown that the hypnotic experience is not the same as sleep, but similar to the kind of state you feel when you are caught up in reading a good book and your attention becomes narrowed and you become less “tuned in” to the things going on around you. In a therapeutic setting, hypnosis is frequently associated with focussing on achieving a state of relaxation, where a person can be receptive to positive suggestions.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, most people can be hypnotised if they have the ability to pay attention to normal events. No one make you do anything in hypnosis, any more than they could in everyday life.</p> 

    <p>Using hypnosis allows you to purposefully achieve a focused, relaxed state on your own, where you can give yourself positive suggestions without the requirement for these to be given by another person.</p>

    <strong>Uses of hypnosis</strong>

    <p>Hypnosis has been applied in variety of clinical settings, to relive pain, help overcome phobia and manage stress and anxiety conditions.  It has also been used to support sports performance and business coaching to promote both mental and physical well-being.</p>

    <strong>Are there any risks associated with the use of hypnosis?</strong>

    <p>The use of hypnosis by fully trained and qualified clinical hypnotherapists in a controlled environment is a safe process. However, there are some instances where certain medical or psychological conditions may suggest that using hypnosis would not be appropriate.  For these reasons referral from a GP maybe requested.</p>
