<p>In his introductory address to the American Psychological Society (1999) Martin Seligman described Positive Psychology as a "science of human strengths." Until this time, most psychological research and treatments had focussed on what was "wrong" with individuals. What Seligman realised was that much could be gained by focussing on what was "right" with people, helping them to recognise and use their own unique, individual's strengths as a means to develop better health and enhance levels of "well-being."</p>

<p>I combine hypnotherapeutic techniques with principles of Positive Psychology, helping you to recognise your unique individual strengths and build on these to support you as you seek to reach your goals.</p>
