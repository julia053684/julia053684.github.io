    <h4><small>Before undertaking hypnotherapy, we will broadly discuss your issues and together decide how hypnotherapy can help you. Also, I will answer any questions you might have about hypnosis which have not been covered already in the information provided on this website.</small></h4>

    <p>At the beginning of the first hypnotherapy session we will discuss your issues and your desired goals. Working together we will decide on what the best outcome would be for you and how to go about achieving this, supported by the use of hypnotherapy.</p>

    <p>Depending on your individual circumstances, hypnotherapy is often a relatively short process and this is also something we would discuss in your first session.</p>

    <p>The hypnotherapy techniques I use are evidence based and will be will tailored to your unique circumstances and preferences.</p> 

    <p>The use of hypnosis by fully trained and qualified clinical hypnotherapists in a controlled environment is a safe process. However, there are some instances where certain medical or psychological conditions may suggest that using hypnosis would not be appropriate.</p> 

    <p>For these reasons, I offer a free, short telephone consultation before you first attend, where we can talk together to ensure that seeking hypnotherapy is the right course of action for you.</p>
