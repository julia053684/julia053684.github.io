    <p>Before undertaking hypnotherapy, we will broadly discuss your issues and together decide how hypnotherapy can help you. Also, I will answer any questions you might have about hypnosis which have not been covered already in the information provided on this website.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of the first hypnotherapy session we will discuss your issues and your desired goals. Working together we will decide on what the best outcome would be for you and how to go about achieving this, supported by the use of hypnotherapy.</p>

    <p>Depending on your individual circumstances, hypnotherapy is often a relatively short process and this is also something we would discuss in your first session.</p>

    <p>The hypnotherapy techniques I use are evidence based and will be will tailored to your unique circumstances and preferences.</p>

    <p>Often, we may consciously wish to take action in relation to a negative behaviour pattern, for example smoking. At a conscious level, we know the health risksâ€¦ and yet...still we continue to smoke. Over time, any repeated actions we take, be they good or bad, become automatic. Take smoking - the desire to light up is controlled by our "unconscious" mind, perhaps linked with a particular situation, location or time of day, without the need for conscious thought to be involved.</p>

    <p>Using hypnosis to create a relaxed, receptive frame of mind, the hypnotherapist can communicate with your unconscious mind to suggest (based on your stated goals and outcomes) more beneficial, healthy alternatives behaviour to those that you no longer have a use for. Positive suggestions, in hypnosis, reach the level of your unconscious mind allowing you to access the individual resources you need to help you as you bring about the positive changes you wish to make.</p>
