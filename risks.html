<p>The use of hypnosis by fully trained and qualified clinical hypnotherapists in a controlled environment is a safe process. However, there are some instances where certain medical or psychological conditions may suggest that using hypnosis would not be appropriate.</p> 

<p>For these reasons, I offer a free, short telephone consultation before you first attend, where we can talk together to ensure that seeking hypnotherapy is the right course of action for you.</p>
